### Workshop Description

The composition of microbial species in a human body is essential for maintaining human health, and it is associated with a number of diseases including obesity, bowel inflammatory disease, and bacterial vaginosis.  Over the last decade, microbiome data analysis  almost entirely shifted towards using samples taken directly from various sites of human body and  to explore a  large number of microbes using 16S or whole metagenome sequencing. This technological shift has led to a radical change  in the data collected and led to the creation  of the  Human Microbiome Project (HMP) in 2008. With the growth and success of the microbiomics field, the size and complexity, and availability of the microbiome data in any given experiment have increased exponentially.  Publicly-available data sets from amplicon sequencing of two 16S ribosomal RNA variable regions, with extensive controlled-access participant data, provide a reference for ongoing microbiome studies. However, utilization of these data sets can be hindered by the complex bioinformatic steps required to access, import, decrypt, and merge the various components in formats suitable for ecological and statistical analysis. 

The main goal of this workshop is to provide a much-needed tutorial on downloading, understanding, and analyzing  the publicly-available HMP data. We will describe the two packages, HMP16SData and HMP2Data, that provide the comprehensive tutorial on the analysis of Phase 1 and 2 of the HMP project, respectively. These packages provide count data for both 16S ribosomal RNA variable regions, integrated with phylogeny, taxonomy, public participant data, and controlled participant data for authorized researchers, using standard integrative Bioconductor data objects.  As such, these packages provide the first comprehensive publicly-available tool for working with  microbiome data collected at different body sites (e.g., fecal, nasal, vaginal) coupled with other omics approaches (e.g., cytokines, whole metagenome), and is conducted longitudinally on multiple subjects at multiple visits. By removing bioinformatic hurdles of data access and management, HMP16SData and HMP2Data  enable researchers with only basic R skills to quickly analyze HMP data. This allows  studying the dynamics of microbial composition over the disease progression, discovering  disease-specific microbial biomarkers, and understanding the role of  microbiome in connection to other omics measurements.  

This workshop will consist of the series  on the instructors-led live demos presented together with  the brief lecture materials and statistical methods review when necessary. Completely worked out examples are available through the HMP16SData and HMP2Data package vignettes.

## Introduction

Bioconductor provides curated resources of microbiome data.  Most microbiome data are generated either by targeted amplicon sequencing (usually of variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene) or by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MGX). These two approaches are analyzed by different sequence analysis tools, but downstream statistical and ecological analysis can involve any of the following types of data:

* taxonomic abundance at different levels of the taxonomic hierarchy
* phylogenetic distances and the phylogenetic tree of life
* metabolic potential of the microbiome
* abundance of microbial genes and gene families

A review of types and properties of microbiome data is provided by [@Morgan2012-mq].

## curatedMetagenomicData: Curated and processed metagenomic data through ExperimentHub

```{r, results="hide", echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(curatedMetagenomicData))
```

`curatedMetagenomicData`[@Pasolli2017-gf] provides 6 types of processed data for >30 publicly available whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing datasets, including from the Human Microbiome Project Phase 1:

1. Species-level taxonomic profiles, expressed as relative abundance from kingdom to strain level
2. Presence of unique, clade-specific markers
3. Abundance of unique, clade-specific markers
4. Abundance of gene families
5. Metabolic pathway coverage
6. Metabolic pathway abundance

Types 1-3 are generated by 
[MetaPhlAn2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan2); 4-6 are generated by [HUMAnN2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2).

Currently, `curatedMetagenomicData` provides:

* `r nrow(combined_metadata)` samples from `r length(unique(combined_metadata$dataset_name))` datasets, primarily of the human gut but including body sites profiled in the Human Microbiome Project
* Processed data from whole-metagenome shotgun metagenomics, with manually-curated metadata, as integrated and documented Bioconductor 
ExpressionSet objects
* ~80 fields of specimen metadata from original papers, supplementary files, and websites, with manual curation to standardize annotations
* Processing of data through the [MetaPhlAn2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan2) pipeline for taxonomic abundance, and [HUMAnN2](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2) pipeline for metabolic analysis
* These represent ~100TB of raw sequencing data, but the processed data provided are much smaller.

These datasets are documented in the 
[reference manual](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/manuals/curatedMetagenomicData/man/curatedMetagenomicData.pdf).

This is an `ExperimentHub` package, and its main workhorse function is `curatedMetagenomicData()`:

The manually curated metadata for all available samples are provided in a single table `combined_metadata`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(curatedMetagenomicData)
?combined_metadata
View(data.frame(combined_metadata))
```

The main function provides a `list` of `ExpressionSet` objects:
```{r, results="hide"}
oral <- c("HMP_2012.metaphlan_bugs_list.oralcavity")
esl <- curatedMetagenomicData(oral, dryrun = FALSE)
```

```{r}
esl
```

These `ExpressionSet` objects can also be converted to `phyloseq` object for ecological analysis and differential abundance analysis using the `DESeq2` package, using the `ExpressionSet2phyloseq()` function:
```{r}
ExpressionSet2phyloseq( esl[[1]], phylogenetictree = TRUE)
```

See the documentation of `phyloseq` for more on ecological and differential abundance analysis of the microbiome.

## HMP16SData: 16S rRNA Sequencing Data from the Human Microbiome Project

```{r, results='hide'}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(HMP16SData))
```

`HMP16SData`[@Schiffer2019-cd] is a Bioconductor ExperimentData package of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) 16S rRNA sequencing data. Taxonomic count data files are provided as downloaded from the HMP Data Analysis and Coordination Center from its QIIME pipeline. Processed data is provided as `SummarizedExperiment` class objects via `ExperimentHub`. Like other ExperimentHub-based packages, a convenience function does downloading, automatic local caching, and serializing of a Bioconductor data class. This returns taxonomic counts from the V1-3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene, along with the unrestricted participant data and phylogenetic tree. 
```{r}
V13()
```

This can also be converted to `phyloseq` for ecological and differential abundance analysis; see the `HMP16SData` vignette for details.

## HMP2Data

### Integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP)  https://hmpdacc.org/ihmp/


```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height= '70%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "iHMP.jpeg"))
```

- One of the largest open data resources for studying longitudinal microbiome changes  and connection to disease

- Novel data -- first scientific results just published  in the special collection of **Nature** and its sister journals (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1238-8) 

```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height= '50%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "Nature.jpeg"))
```

- Human Microbiome Project Data Portal (https://portal.hmpdacc.org/)
- Open data -- but not straightforward to download and work with

```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height= '70%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "DAC.jpeg"))
```

- Need **Aspera client** to even download the data  -- not every lab/researcher has these expertise available 
- Still need multiple processing steps after data is downloaded to: 

1. map taxonomy ids from the database

2. merge with meta data -- not available on the DAC portal

3. construct phylogenetic tree

4. merge omics data.


### HMP2Data package 

The following packages will be used in this vignette to provide demonstrative
examples of what a user might do with `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("HMP2Data")`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(phyloseq)
  library(SummarizedExperiment)
  library(MultiAssayExperiment)
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(UpSetR)
  library(ade4)
  library(vegan)
  library(MiRKAT)
})
```


`HMP2Data` package is currently under review as a Bioconductor package. Current (development) version can be installed can be installed from John Stansfield's GitHub repository https://github.com/jstansfield0/HMP2Data as follows. This is the version used for the workshop.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("jstansfield0/HMP2Data")
```

The stable version is available at the dozmorovlab GitHub repository https://github.com/dozmorovlab/HMP2Data 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("dozmorovlab/HMP2Data")
```

Load `HMP2Data` package

```{r}

```


Once installed, `HMP2Data` provides functions to access the data from the three major HMP2 studies. 


#### Multi-omics microbiome study pregnancy initiavite (MOMS-PI) 


- Vaginal microbiome consortium study at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) http://vmc.vcu.edu/momspi 

```{r, out.width = '50%', out.height= '20%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "momspi.jpeg"))
```

- Pre-term birth study results: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0450-2
- Trem-birth study: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0465-8
- Only a subset of samples available on the DAC portal was used in current publications
- Novel longitudinal and multi-omics models have not yet been throughly explored
- Data structure gives many opportunities for statistical models development and data exploration 

# Metadata (MOMS-PI) [``dbGap"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001523.v1.p1#authorized-requests-section)



```{r, out.width = '60%', out.height= '40%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "dbGap.jpeg"))
```


```{r, out.width = '60%', out.height= '40%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "dbGap2.jpeg"))
```


##### 16S data 

Load 16S data as a matrix, rows are Greengene IDs, columns are sample names:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("momspi16S_mtx")
```

Load the Greengenes taxonomy table as a matrix, rows are Greengene IDs, columns are taxonomic ranks:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("momspi16S_tax")
# Check if Greengene IDs match between the 16S and taxonomy data
# all.equal(rownames(momspi16S_mtx), rownames(momspi16S_tax)) # Should be TRUE
```

Load the 16S sample annotation data as a matrix, rows are samples, columns are annotations:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("momspi16S_samp")

# Check if sample names match between the 16S and sample data
# all.equal(colnames(momspi16S_mtx), rownames(momspi16S_samp)) # Should be TRUE
```

The `momspi16S` function assembles those matrices into a `phyloseq` object.

```{r, message=FALSE}
momspi16S_phyloseq <- momspi16S()
momspi16S_phyloseq
```

##### Cytokine data

The MOMS-PI cytokine data can be loaded as a matrix, rownames are cytokine names, colnames are sample names:

```{r}
data("momspiCyto_mtx")
momspiCyto_mtx[1:5, 1:3]
```

The cytokine data has `r nrow(momspiCyto_mtx)` variables (cytokines) and `r ncol(momspiCyto_mtx)` samples.

Load the cytokine sample annotation data as a matrix, rows are samples, columns are annotations:

```{r}
data("momspiCyto_samp")
colnames(momspiCyto_samp)
```

The function `momspiCytokines` will make a `SummarizedExperiment` containing cytokine data

```{r}
momspiCyto <- momspiCytokines()
momspiCyto
```


#### Inflammatory bowel diseases: IBD

* Fecal microbiome study 3 groups: Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and controls

knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "IBD.jpeg"))
```


Load 16S data as a matrix, rows are SILVA IDs, columns are sample names:

```{r}

```{r}
data("IBD16S_samp")
colnames(IBD16S_samp) %>% head()
```

The IBD `phyloseq` object can be loaded as follows.

```{r}
IBD <- IBD16S()
IBD
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#short term fix: will be updated in the new package version
sample_data(IBD)$sample_body_site <- "feces"
sample_data(IBD)$subject_race <- ifelse(sample_data(IBD)$race == "White", "caucasian",
                                        ifelse(sample_data(IBD)$race == "American Indian or Alaska Native", "american_indian_or_alaska_native", 
                                               ifelse(sample_data(IBD)$race == "Black or African American", "african_american", "ethnic_other")))
```


#### T2D

Load 16S data as a matrix, rows are Greengene IDs, columns are sample names:

```{r}
data("T2D16S_mtx")
```

Load the Greengenes taxonomy table as a matrix, rows are Greengene IDs, columns are taxonomic ranks:

```{r}
data("T2D16S_tax")
colnames(T2D16S_tax)
```

Load the 16S sample annotation data as a matrix, rows are samples, columns are annotations:

```{r}
data("T2D16S_samp")
colnames(T2D16S_samp)
```

The T2D `phyloseq` object can be loaded like so.

```{r}
T2D <- T2D16S()
T2D
```

### Features

#### Frequency Table Generation

The sample-level annotation data contianed in `HMP2Data` can be summarized using the `table_two` function. First, we need to make a list of the `phyloseq` and `SummarizedExperiment` objects which can then be entered into the `table_two()` table generating function.


```{r}
list("MOMS-PI 16S" = momspi16S_phyloseq, "MOMS-PI Cytokines" = momspiCyto, "IBD 16S" = IBD, "T2D 16S" = T2D) %>% 
  table_two()%>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = F, font_size = 12)

```


#### Visits Histograms

We can plot the histogram of the number of samples at each visit for all studies. 
Note that the X-axis is capped at count of 40 for better visualization.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
# make data.frame for plotting
plot_visits <- data.frame(study = c(rep("MOMS-PI 16S", nrow(momspi16S_samp)),
                     rep("MOMS-PI Cytokines", nrow(momspiCyto_samp)),
                     rep("IBD 16S", nrow(IBD16S_samp)),
                     rep("T2D 16S", nrow(T2D16S_samp))),
          visits = c(momspi16S_samp$visit_number,
                     momspiCyto_samp$visit_number,
                     IBD16S_samp$visit_number,
                     T2D16S_samp$visit_number))
p2 <- ggplot(plot_visits, aes(x = visits, fill = study)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7, bins = 30, color = "darkgray") + xlim(c(0, 40)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8))  + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "yellow", 
                             "seagreen3", "red"))+
  xlab("Visit number") + ylab("Count")+theme_bw()
p2
```

Note that there are `r sum(plot_visits$visits > 40)` samples at visit numbers over 40.

### UpsetR plots

#### MOMS-PI 16S rRNA data

Here we plot the body sites which samples were taken from for each patient in the MOMS-PI 16S data.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10, eval=FALSE}
# set up data.frame for UpSetR
momspi_upset <- aggregate(momspi16S_samp$sample_body_site, by = list(momspi16S_samp$subject_id), table)
tmp <- as.matrix(momspi_upset[, -1])
tmp <- (tmp > 0) *1
momspi_upset <- data.frame(patient = momspi_upset$Group.1, tmp)

# plot
upset(momspi_upset, order.by = 'freq', matrix.color = "blue", text.scale = 2)
```

#### MOMS-PI Cytokines data

Here we plot the body sites which samples were taken from for each patient in the MOMS-PI cytokines data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# set up data.frame for UpSetR
momspiCyto_upset <- aggregate(momspiCyto_samp$sample_body_site, by = list(momspiCyto_samp$subject_id), table)
tmp <- as.matrix(momspiCyto_upset[, -1])
tmp <- (tmp > 0) *1
momspiCyto_upset <- data.frame(patient = momspiCyto_upset$Group.1, tmp)

# plot
upset(momspiCyto_upset, order.by = 'freq', matrix.color = "blue", text.scale = 2)
```

#### IBD data

The IBD patients only had samples taken from the feces.

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # set up data.frame for UpSetR -->
<!-- IBD_upset <- aggregate(IBD16S_samp$sample_body_site, by = list(IBD16S_samp$subject_id), table) -->
<!-- tmp <- as.matrix(IBD_upset[, -1]) -->
<!-- tmp <- (tmp > 0) *1 -->
<!-- IBD_upset <- data.frame(patient = IBD_upset$Group.1, tmp) -->

<!-- # plot -->
<!-- upset(IBD_upset, order.by = 'freq') -->
<!-- ``` -->


#### T2D data

Here we plot the body sites which samples were taken from for each patient in the T2D 16S rRNA data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# set up data.frame for UpSetR
T2D_upset <- aggregate(T2D16S_samp$sample_body_site, by = list(T2D16S_samp$subject_id), table)
tmp <- as.matrix(T2D_upset[, -1])
tmp <- (tmp > 0) *1
T2D_upset <- data.frame(patient = T2D_upset$Group.1, tmp)

# plot
upset(T2D_upset, order.by = 'freq', matrix.color = "blue", text.scale = 2)
```


## Microbiome Analyses: IBD example


```{r}

Table1Var <- c("subject_gender", "Age.at.diagnosis", "race", "visit_number",
               "site_name", "Education.Level", "Antibiotics", "BMI")

demo_data = sample_data(IBD)[ ,c("sample_id", "subject_id", Table1Var, "diagnosis")] %>%
            data.frame()

#all <- CreateTableOne(vars = Table1Var, data = demo_data)
#kableone(all)

stratified = tableone::CreateTableOne(
  vars = Table1Var,
  data = summarytools::unlabel(demo_data), strata = "diagnosis", includeNA = TRUE)
stratified <- print(stratified, printToggle = FALSE, showAllLevels = FALSE)
stratified[,!(colnames(stratified) %in% "test")]%>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html", caption = "Characteristics of the Study Cohort",
               col.names = c(col.names = c("Crohn’s disease \n(CD)", "Control", 
                             "Ulcerative colitis  \n(UC)", "p-value")))%>% 
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = T)

```


### Alpha diversity analysis 

#### Alpha Diversity Definitions 

Alpha diversity is a within-sample diversity measurement that models the richness and/or eveness of the microbial community. 


```{r, out.width = '70%', out.height= '60%', results='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file(package='MicrobiomeWorkshop', 'vignettes', "diversity.png"))
```


Different alpha diversities emphasize different aspect of the community. Commonly used alpha diversities include: 


| Diversity        |Description           | Formula  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|Observed Species    |No. of unique taxa in a sample| Number of species | 
|Chao 1      |Adding a correction to observed species    | $S_{ob} + \frac{n_1^2}{2n_2}$ |
|Shannon |Both richness and evenness     |$-\sum_{i=1}^{s} p_i \log(p_i)$ |
|Simpson reciprocal|Both richness and evenness|$\frac{N(N - 1)}{n(n-1)}$|
|Pielou's evenness|evenness |$\frac{H}{H_{max}}$|

Of course, the alpha diversity measurement is impacted by the sequencing depth (total number of reads per sample). Rarefying (through vegan:rarefy) is necessary before calculating alpha diversity.

#### Comparing Alpha Diversities between Groups

We can use "plot_richness" from phyloseq package to plot the alpha diversities. 

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
IBD %<>%
  taxa_sums() %>%
  is_greater_than(0) %>%
  prune_taxa(IBD)
sample_data(IBD)$diagnosis = factor(sample_data(IBD)$diagnosis)

p = plot_richness(IBD, x="diagnosis", color="diagnosis", measures=c("Observed", "InvSimpson", "Shannon", "Chao1")) + geom_jitter()
p + geom_boxplot(data = p$data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = value, color = NULL), alpha = 0.1)
```

Once we summarize the whole community through a one-dimensional summary statistics (alpha diversity), all the traditional methods for hypothesis testing are applicable. 

```{r}
alpha = estimate_richness(IBD, measures=c("Observed", "InvSimpson", "Shannon"))
alpha_df = data.frame(sample_data(IBD)[,c("sample_id","subject_id")], alpha)
rownames(alpha_df) = NULL
kable(head(alpha_df),
      digits = 3,caption = "Some Alpha Diversities of the IBD dataset") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F,position = "center") 
```


### Beta diversity analysis

Beta diversity describes how samples vary against each other. Beta diversity is typically the thinking behind "clustering" algorithms that show differences or similarities among samples. For example, we may be intrested in the differences in gut microbiome between non IBD and IBD patients. 

List of the commonly used beta-diversities:

| Diversity        |Description           |Formula| 
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-----:|
|UniFrac   |Qualitative, Phylogenetics-based |$\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{b_i|I(p_i^A > 0)-I(p_i^B > 0)|}{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}$| 
|Weighted UniFrac     |Quantitative,Phylogenetics-based|$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i|p_i^A - p_i^B|}{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(p_i^A + p_i^B)}$|
|Generalized UniFrac |Compromise between the previous two |$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i (p_i^A + p_i^B)^{\alpha} |\frac{p_i^A - p_i^B}{p_i^A + p_i^B}|} {\sum_{i=1}^nb_i(p_i^A + p_i^B)^{\alpha}}$|
|Bray-Curtis|Quantitative|$1 - \frac{2C_{i,j}}{S_i + S_j}$|
|Jaccard | Qualitative| $\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$|

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
jac <- as.matrix(distance(t(otu_table(IBD)), method = "jaccard"))
mod1 <- vegan::betadisper(as.dist(jac), as.factor(IBD16S_samp$diagnosis))
plot(mod1, ellipse = TRUE, hull = FALSE, main="Jaccard Distance", xlab="PC 1", ylab="PC 2", sub=NULL)
box()

bc = as.matrix(ecodist::bcdist(t(otu_table(IBD))))
mod2 <- vegan::betadisper(as.dist(bc), as.factor(IBD16S_samp$diagnosis))

```


##### Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance

Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) [@McArdle2001Fit], a non-parametric multivariate statistical test, is one commonly used for assessing the association between microbiome community and a phenotype (e.g., IBD or not). 

However, the PERMANOVA approach, by itself, doesn't allow for repeated measures. Ignoring the repeated measures (treating them as if they are all independent samples) can lead to inflated type I error (i.e., more false positive discoveries than we would like to accept through our p-value cutoff). However, we can use the method if we consider a subset of the samples which are independent with each other, such as those from the baseline. 

PERMANOVA requires the selection of a single distance metric. Howeve, if the selected distance metric doesn't capture the underlying association pattern, PERMANOVA tends to lose power. 

```{r}
IBD0 = subset_samples(IBD,  week_num == 0&diagnosis %in% c("nonIBD", "CD"))
IBD0 %<>%
  taxa_sums() %>%
  is_greater_than(0) %>%
  prune_taxa(IBD0)

jac0 <- as.matrix(distance(t(otu_table(IBD0)), method = "jaccard"))
bc0 =  as.matrix(ecodist::bcdist(t(otu_table(IBD0))))
CD = as.numeric(sample_data(IBD0)$diagnosis == "CD")
gender = as.numeric(factor(sample_data(IBD0)$subject_gender))

fit = vegan::adonis(bc0 ~ gender + CD, permutations=500)
kable(fit$aov.tab,
      digits = 3,caption = "PERMANOVA result using Bray-Curtis distance") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)  
```

##### Microbiome Regression Kernel Association Test (MiRKAT)

MiRKAT: a regression approach for flexibly associating the microbial community with phenotype of interest [@Zhao2015MiRKAT]. The method also has extensions that can handle longitudinal measures [@GLMMMiRKAT], multivariate [@Zhan_MMiRKAT] and survial outcomes [@Plantinga2017].  

$g(y_i) = X_i\beta + f(\boldsymbol M_i) + \epsilon_i,$
$f \sim$ a reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by function $K$. 
Equivalently, 
$\boldsymbol f \sim N(0, \tau\boldsymbol K)$, in which $\boldsymbol K$ is a similarity matrix that can be calculated through a distance metric. 

Multiple kernels (distances) are allowed simulatenously in this framework, making this procedure robust to the underlying association patterns. 

```{r}
 K_bc = MiRKAT::D2K(bc0); K_jac = D2K(jac0)
 y = ifelse(sample_data(IBD0)$diagnosis == "CD",1, 0 )
 out = MiRKAT::MiRKAT(y=y, X = gender, Ks = list(K_bc, K_jac), out_type = "D") 
```


## Multi-omics data integration: MOMS-PI example

Combine 16S and cytokines data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#order both sets by visit number within a subject
momspi16S_samp <- momspi16S_samp[
  with(momspi16S_samp, order(subject_id, sample_body_site, visit_number)),
] 

momspiCyto_samp <- momspiCyto_samp[
  with(momspiCyto_samp, order(subject_id, sample_body_site, visit_number)),
] 

```

```{r}
#select data collected at the same visit
combined_samp <- merge(momspi16S_samp, momspiCyto_samp, 
                       by = c("subject_id", "sample_body_site", 
                        "project_name", "study_full_name",
                        "subject_gender", "subject_race",
                        "visit_number"))

```

In this tutorial, we concentrate on cross-sectional analysis of the first visit data, which corresponds to earlier time during pregnancy.   

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#select data from first visit only
combined_samp <- combined_samp[combined_samp$visit_number ==  1,]

table(combined_samp$sample_body_site)#all vaginal samples
```


We match the samples (contained in columns of both tables)  by the file names contained in colnames of each table.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#select 16S data for those samples
combined_16S_phyloseq <- subset_samples(momspi16S_phyloseq, file_name %in% combined_samp$file_name.x)

#get rif of otus that are not observed in any sample for this subset
combined_16S_phyloseq %<>%
    taxa_sums() %>%
    is_greater_than(0) %>%
    prune_taxa(combined_16S_phyloseq)

combined_16S_mtx <- otu_table(combined_16S_phyloseq)

#can get same data directly from matrices, but less convenient because phyloseq has taxonomy info
#combined_16S_mtx <- momspi16S_mtx[, colnames(momspi16S_mtx) %in% combined_samp$file_name.x]
#get rif of otus that are not observed in any sample for this subset
#combined_16S_mtx <- combined_16S_mtx[apply(combined_16S_mtx, 1, nnzero) >0, ]

combined_Cyto_mtx <- momspiCyto_mtx[, colnames(momspiCyto_mtx) %in% combined_samp$file_name.y ]
dim(combined_Cyto_mtx)
```


In `combined_samp` object the names of matched files names for 16S data are recorded in column `file.x` and for cytokines data in column `file.y`. 



```{r, echo = FALSE}
#make sure all samples across 3 tables are in the same order
combined_samp <- combined_samp[order(combined_samp$subject_id),]
#reorder cytokines samples
combined_Cyto_mtx <- combined_Cyto_mtx[,combined_samp$file_name.y]
#reorder taxa samples
combined_16S_mtx <- combined_16S_mtx[,combined_samp$file_name.x]
```

Make sure that samples are in rows and variables (taxa and cytokines) are in columns. 


```{r}
combined_16S_mtx <- t(combined_16S_mtx)
combined_Cyto_mtx <- t(combined_Cyto_mtx)
```

Taxa are converted to proportions.

```{r}
combined_16S_mtx <- combined_16S_mtx/apply(combined_16S_mtx, 1, sum)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#cut the last 5 characters that correspond to the -omics type identifier
rownames(combined_Cyto_mtx) <- substr(
  rownames(combined_Cyto_mtx), 1,nchar(rownames(combined_Cyto_mtx))-5)

rownames(combined_16S_mtx) <- substr(
  rownames(combined_16S_mtx), 1,nchar(rownames(combined_16S_mtx))-5)

#make sure all rownames match
#all(rownames(combined_16S_mtx) == rownames(combined_16S_mtx))
```


### Co-inertia analysis


1. Let $X$ and $Y$ be 16S and cytokines tables respectively
2. Rows: same $n$ women at first visit
3. Columns: $p_1$ taxa and $p_2$ cytokines
4. Column weights: $Q_X$ and $Q_Y$
5. Row weights: $D$
6. PCA analysis of each table: $(X, Q_X, D)$ and $(Y, Q_Y, D)$
7. Co-inertia axes: $Y^TDX = K\Lambda^{1/2}A^T$ from eigendecomposition of $(Y^TDX, Q_X, Q_Y)$
8. Plot $F_X = XA$ and $F_Y = YK$

Taxa normalization:

1. Center  16S data to work with PCA on the covariance matrix $\Sigma_X = Cov(X)$ 
2. To normalize the magnitude,  divide each value of $X$ by the total variance: $\sqrt{\mbox{tr}(\Sigma_X)}$
3. Note: step 2 is quivalent to dividing the matrix by $\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^r \lambda_k}$, where $\lambda_k$ are the eigevalues of $\Sigma_X$ and $r$ is the rank of $X$.  

```{r, echo = TRUE}
taxa_mtx <- scale(combined_16S_mtx, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
#use fast trace computation formula: tr(A^B) = sum(A*B), where '*' operator refers to elemetwise product
taxa_tr <- sum(taxa_mtx*taxa_mtx)/(dim(taxa_mtx)[1]-1)
taxa_mtx <- taxa_mtx/sqrt(taxa_tr)
taxa.pca <- ade4::dudi.pca(taxa_mtx, scannf=FALSE, nf =61,
                     center = FALSE, scale = FALSE)
```

Cytokines normalization:

1. Center  and scale cytokines data to work with PCA on the correlation matrix $\Sigma_X = Cor(Y)$
2. To normalize the magnitude,  divide each value of $Y$ by the total variance: $\sqrt{\mbox{tr}(\Sigma_Y)}$ 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
cyto_mtx <- scale(combined_Cyto_mtx, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
cyto_tr <- sum(cyto_mtx*cyto_mtx)/(dim(cyto_mtx)[1]-1)
cyto_mtx <- cyto_mtx/sqrt(cyto_tr)
cyto.pca <- ade4::dudi.pca(cyto_mtx, scannf=FALSE, nf =61,
                     center = FALSE, scale = FALSE)

```


### Combine the tables using co-inertia

Co-inertia is available through R package `ade4`. It takes `ade4` PCA objects and performes joint eigendecomposition. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
coin <- ade4::coinertia(taxa.pca, cyto.pca, scannf = FALSE, nf = 2)
```

RV coefficient -- measure of similarity between 16S and cytokines tables

```{r, echo = TRUE}
RV <- coin$RV
RV
```

### Visualization of output


```{r, echo= FALSE}
p.vars <- PlotCoinVars(coin, tab1 = "taxa", tab2 = "cytokines", 
             Labels1 = NULL, #colnames(combined_16S_mtx)
             Labels2 = colnames(combined_Cyto_mtx),
             label = TRUE,PtSize=2,LblSize=3,
             hjust = 0, vjust = -1.5)
p.vars
```


Interpretation of the plots is similar to examining PCA results. 

Plot below provides variables projection on common co-inertia axes. 

1. Variables projected close to each other reflect similarilty within and across two data sets 

2. Variables with larger values on each component (x- and y-axes) have more importance  

We start by identifying important taxa (larger component values):

1. visually from the plot, or 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
taxa.inx <- c(6,  19,  24,  28,  31,  68,  69, 396)
```

2. by specifying x and y coordinates to pull all variables with coordinates larger (or smaller) than these values. Table 1 (taxa) values can be accessed $co object of coinertia output named coin. 

```{r}
kable(head(coin$co),
      digits = 5)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#extract scores for each table
  x = colnames(coin$co)[1]
  y = colnames(coin$co)[2]
  
#first table data
  df1 <- data.frame(coin$co$Comp1, coin$co$Comp2, Labels1 = 1:nrow(coin$co), rep("taxa", nrow(coin$co)))
  rownames(df1) <- rownames(coin$co)
  names(df1) <- c(x,y,  "Labels", "Table")
  
#extract influential taxa
  xval = c(-0.002, 0.007)
  yval = c(-0.002, 0.01)
  taxa = subset(df1, 
        (Comp1 < xval[1] |Comp1 > xval[2]) &  (Comp2 < yval[1] |Comp2 > yval[2]))
  taxa.inx <-taxa$Labels
```

Similarly, table 2 (here cytokines) variables loadings can be extracted from the  $li object of coinertia output named coin. 

```{r}
kable(head(coin$li),
      digits = 5)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
taxa.ids <- colnames(combined_16S_mtx)[taxa.inx]
#look up these taxa ids in phyloqes
taxa.names <- tax_table(momspi16S_phyloseq)[rownames(tax_table(momspi16S_phyloseq)) %in% taxa.ids,c("Family", "Genus", "Species")]
taxa.names <- cbind(taxa.ids = rownames(taxa.names), taxa.names)
x = cbind(taxa.ids, taxa.inx)
taxa.names <- merge(taxa.names, x, by="taxa.ids")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p.vars

kable(taxa.names[,c("taxa.ids", "taxa.inx", "Family", "Genus", "Species")],
      caption = "Influential taxa",
      col.names =c("Greengene ID", "Plot ID", "Family", "Genus", "Species"))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
```


Sample scores plots. Length of the arrows indicates the samples that have larger differences across two data sets.

```{r, echo= FALSE}

Samp.coin <- CoinertiaPlot(coin = coin, 
                  Quant = 0.95, Prop.Var = 0.9,
                  Env_Var=NULL, 
                  Env_Var2 = NULL,
                  color=NULL, shape=NULL,
                  PtColor= "magenta",PtShape=1, PtSize=1,
                  linetype=2, LblSize=4, 
                  LabelsOpt = 1:nrow(coin$mX),
                  ArrLen=0.10, ArrAngle=20)

Samp.coin$p + theme_bw()

```

Samples with largest difference across two data sets. Samples with arrow lengths in 0.9 quantile are chosen. 

```{r}
#Taxa with major differences across two sets
large.difs <- rownames(Samp.coin$Dissimilarity[Samp.coin$Dissimilarity$Quantile >= 0.9, ])
```

Samples with largest differences across two data sets.

```{r}
small.difs <- rownames(Samp.coin$Dissimilarity[Samp.coin$Dissimilarity$Quantile < 0.1, ])
```



```{r, echo = FALSE}
df1 <- data.frame(large_ID = match(large.difs, rownames(coin$mX)), large_name = large.difs)
df2 <- data.frame(small_ID = match(small.difs, rownames(coin$mX)), small_name = small.difs)
df <- cbind(df1, df2)

```
